# My FL Studio Clone Project

This is a front-end only project that clones various pages from the official FL Studio website using **HTML only**, with *no CSS files* and minimal inline styling.

## 📌 About

This repository contains the HTML source files for a static clone of FL Studio pages such as:
- Homepage
- Pricing
- Learn page grid
- Sign In / Sign Up forms

The project does **not** include any backend, database, or server-side logic — it is purely a static HTML prototype.

## 🧩 Features

- Clean HTML structure
- Minimal inline styles
- No external CSS frameworks
- Clickable navigation between pages
- Sign In / Sign Up mock forms

📋 Notes

This project at present contains only HTML and browser navigation.

No CSS files are used - only inline ```style=""``` where necessary.

Sign-in and Sign-up are mock forms and do not perform real authentication.
